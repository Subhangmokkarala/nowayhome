    <h1><center>Welcome to Sony Marvel No Way Home Official page</center> </h1>
    <p align="center" ><b>No Way Home is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is intended to be the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Jon Watts, written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Marisa Tomei, J. B. Smoove, Benedict Wong, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to help make his identity as Spider-Man a secret following its public revelation at the end of Far From Home, which leads to the multiverse breaking open.

        A third MCU Spider-Man film was intended as early as 2017, during production on Homecoming. By August 2019, negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal—in which they produce the Spider-Man films together—ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project; however, a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the two companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return at that time. Filming began in October 2020 in New York City, before moving to Atlanta later that month. During filming, Foxx and Molina were revealed to be appearing in the film, reprising characters from past Spider-Man films, with more past actors and the multiverse concept of the film revealed later. The title was revealed in February 2021, before filming wrapped at the end of March.
        
        Spider-Man: No Way Home is scheduled to be released in the United States on December 17, 2021, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. A fourth Spider-Man film is in development.</b> </p>
<p id="320"><dl>Cast</dl> 
    <b id="321" style="color:black;font-size: large;"> Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:
        A teenager and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[3] The film explores the fallout of Spider-Man: Far From Home's (2019) mid-credits scene, in which Parker's identity as Spider-Man is exposed,[2] and Parker is more pessimistic in contrast to previous Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films. Holland said that Parker feels defeated and insecure, and was excited to explore the darker side of the character.[4] The adjustment back to portraying Parker, including raising his voice pitch and returning to the mindset of a "naive, charming teenager", was strange for Holland after taking on more mature roles such as in Cherry (2021).[5]
        Zendaya as MJ: Parker's classmate and girlfriend.[6] Her full name is Michelle Jones.[7]
        Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange:
        A neurosurgeon who became a Master of the Mystic Arts following a career-ending car accident. Strange takes on the mentor role for Parker that was filled by Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury in Far From Home.[8] Holland disagrees that Strange is a mentor to Parker, but sees them instead as "colleagues" and notes that their relationship breaks down throughout the course of the film.[9] Cumberbatch felt there was a close relationship between Strange and Parker because both are "neighborhood superheroes" with a shared history.[10]
        Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds: Parker's best friend.[11] Batalon lost 102 pounds (46 kg) for his role in this film.[12]
        Jon Favreau as Harold "Happy" Hogan: The head of security for Stark Industries and former driver and bodyguard of Tony Stark who looks after Parker.[13]
        Marisa Tomei as May Parker: Parker's aunt.[14]
        J. B. Smoove as Julius Dell: Parker's teacher.[15]
        Benedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts and Strange's mentor and friend.[13]
        Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus:
        A scientist from an alternate reality with four artificially intelligent mechanical tentacles fused to his body after an accident. Molina reprises his role from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (2004),[16] with this appearance continuing from the character's story and presumed death in that film. Molina was surprised by this approach because he had aged in the years since he made that film and no longer had the same physicality; digital de-aging was used to make Molina appear as he had in Spider-Man 2.[17] The mechanical tentacles were created through CGI, rather than through puppetry like Spider-Man 2.[18]
        Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon / Electro:
        An electrical tradesman from an alternate reality who gains electric powers after an accident. Foxx reprises his role from Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). Foxx stated that Electro will not be depicted as blue, unlike The Amazing Spider-Man 2.[11][19]</b>
